# IGSL Incident Report: Unauthorized Use of readme.txt for Index Override

## Date of Discovery
**May 13, 2025**

## Reported By
**IGSL Cyberist Team**

---

## Summary of Incident
An unauthorized attempt to override the main website content was detected on [https://igsl.asia](https://igsl.asia). A suspicious file named `readme.txt` was discovered being executed in a way that appeared to trigger or override the site’s `index.php`, resulting in the display of unauthorized advertisements — specifically promoting gambling-related content (e.g., "Slot Gacor").

---

## Details

- **File Involved:** `readme.txt`
- **Location:** Root or publicly accessible directory of `igsl.asia`
- **Effect:** Override or manipulation of the homepage or part of the site's output, leading to a malicious or misleading ad being displayed.
- **Content Displayed:** External ad content, promoting gambling websites.
- **Vector:** The exact exploit mechanism is under further investigation, but evidence suggests that the file was either directly executed or indirectly referenced via a vulnerable plugin/theme or misconfiguration.

## Actions Taken

### Immediate Removal of `readme.txt`
The suspicious file has been isolated and removed from the live server.

### Index File Restored
`index.php` was verified to ensure no modifications or injections remained.

### Security Audit
- A full audit of file permissions, plugin integrity, and access logs is ongoing.
- Any outdated plugins/themes are being patched or disabled.

### Google Search Cleanup
URL inspections and removal requests are being sent to Google Search Console to prevent lingering display of the malicious content in search results.

## Next Steps

1. Full server log review for suspicious activity around the time of the file's deployment.
2. Audit of upload permissions and disablement of file execution from text-based extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.log`).
3. Reinforcement of WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules to block similar attempts in the future.
4. Regular malware scanning and file integrity monitoring scheduled to run automatically.

## Conclusion
This incident appears to be an attempt at exploiting weak file handling or permission issues to display unauthorized content through a benign-looking text file. The IGSL Cyberist Team acted immediately upon discovery, removed the malicious content, and continues to harden the system against similar future threats.
